### ü™ßü™ßü™ß ANNOUNCEMENT ü™ßü™ßü™ß
- This Repo does not contain Hyprland Dots or configs! Dotfiles can be checked here [`Hyprland-Dots`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots) . During installation, if you opt to copy pre-configured dots, it will be downloaded from that centralized repo.
- Hyprland-Dots use are constantly evolving / improving. you can check CHANGELOGS here [`Hyprland-Dots-Changelogs`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Changelogs)
- Since the Hyprland-Dots are evolving, some of the screenshots maybe old
- the wallpaper offered to be downloaded towards the end is from this [`REPO`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Wallpaper-Bank)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> install a backup tool like `snapper` or `timeshift`. and Backup your system before installing hyprland using this script. This script does NOT include uninstallation of packages

> [!NOTE]
> Main reason why I have not included an uninstallation script is simple. Some packages maybe already installed on your system by default. If I create an uninstall script with packages that I have set to install, you may end up a unrecoverable system.

> [!CAUTION]
> Download this script on a directory where you have write permissions. ie. HOME. Or any directory within your home directory. Else script will fail

#### üÜï  Prerequisites
- This install script is intended for atleast Server type / Minimal Arch Linux installed.

> [!NOTE]
> üîò Pipewire and Pipewire audio
- This script will install pipewire and will also disable or will uninstall pulseaudio. If you dont want it, edit install.sh, about line 191 and comment the line  `execute_script "pipewire.sh"` or you can simply just delete pipewire.sh in install-scripts directory before installing.

#### ‚ú® Customize the packages to be installed
- inside the install-scripts directory, you can edit 00-hypr-pkgs.sh. Care though as the Hyprland Dots may not work properly!

#### üí´ SDDM and GTK Themes offered
- If you opted to install SDDM theme, here's the [`LINK`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/simple-sddm-2)
- If you opted to install GTK Themes, Icons, here's the [`LINK`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/GTK-themes-icons) & Bibata Cursor Modern Ice (assets directory)

#### üëÄ NVidia GPU Owners.
- By default, nvidia-dkms will be installed. and only supports GTX 900 and newer. If required to install older driver, edit the nvidia.sh in install-scripts directory
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to use nouveau driver, choose N when asked if you have nvidia gpu. This is because the nvidia installer part, it will blacklist nouveau. Hyprland will still be installed but it will skip blacklisting nouveau.
- After installation, check [`THIS`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Notes_to_remember#--for-nvidia-gpu-users)

## ‚ú® to use this script
> clone this repo (latest commit only) to reduce file size download by using git. Change directory, make executable and run the script

To apply Bibata modern ice cursor, launch nwg-look (GTK Settings) through rofi.~~ Hyprland-Dots v2.1.18, initial boot file will attempt to apply GTK themes,cursor, and icons.

#### ‚ùó some known issues for nvidia
- reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit  to @Kenni Fix stated was
```
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to
)
```
- add "env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX" to the ENVvariables config `~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/ENVariables.conf`  ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to

- more info from the hyprland wiki [`Hyprland Wiki Link`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/FAQ/#my-external-monitor-is-blank--doesnt-render--receives-no-signal-laptop)


- reports from a member of discord for Nvidia for additional env's
- remove # from the following env's on
```
env = GBM_BACKEND,nvidia-drm
env = WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE,1
```

#### ‚ùó other known issues
- [ ] If you are using this script on an Arch-Based distros like Arco linux, or cachy OS or EOS or Manjaro, make sure to install pipewire, pipewire-pulse & pipewire-audio first. Arco Linux, on some of their ISO's still shipped with pulseaudio as audio backend. You will experience getting "stuck" on installation.
- [ ] To install pipewire and its services , `sudo pacman -S pipewire wireplumber pipewire-audio pipewire-pulse` . When prompted, remove / replace pulseaudio. After that, you can ran `./install.sh`
- [ ] installing of cava-git on a newly installed Arch makes the install keep hanging. Switched back to cava. After booting and logged in, if cava dont work, replace it cava-git `yay -S cava-git` or `paru -S cava-git`
> [!NOTE]
> Auto start of Hyprland after login (no SDDM or GDM or any login managers)
- [ ] This was disabled a few days ago. (19 May 2024). This was because some users, after they used the Distro-Hyprland scripts with other DE (gnome-wayland or plasma-wayland), if they choose to login into gnome-wayland for example, Hyprland is starting.
- [ ] to avoid this, I disabled it. You can re-enable again by editing `~/.zprofile` . Remove all the # on the first lines
